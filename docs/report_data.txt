Diffusion models are one of the most popular methods for neural image synthesis. The mechanism used for image syntheis can be 
translated across different data domains, such as text, and audio. Considering the improvements to these models,
theer are several aspects that can be improved such as the quality iof the synthesized image, training cost, and the speed
of generating images.

Even though literature has provided a sound theoretical framework, on which to build diffusion models, it is still unclear
on how to navigate the design space of diffusion models to maximize the desired improvements.
The paper we proposed to reproduce whiose results, focused on the tangible attributes of diffusion models, that 
help in navigating the design space more efficiently, rather than focusing on the underlying theoretical work.
In doing so, the authors provide a new perspective to understanding diffusion models, enabling researchers to better understand the 
processes behind them.
They demonstarte this by focusing on a broad class of nerual networks, that are used to predit the score of a a marginal
distribution of the training data, which is corrupted by Gaussian noise. The score is the gradient of the log likelighood
of the probability density with respect to the dataset, where the probability densityis parameterized
by theta and represents the density of the dataset [https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~vincentp/Publications/smdae_techreport.pdf,
A Connection Between Score Matching
and Denoising Autoencoders]
. Specifically, the authors focus on the 
denosiign score matching.

Score matching is an alternative to MLE (Maximum Likelihood Estimation) for unnormalized probability density models, whose 
partition function (the definite integral of the unnormalized density function over its entire domain ). In score matching, instead of matching
the probability density with real density, whose partition function may be unknonw, we match the score of the distirubtion w.r.t to the dataset
(in cases where real density in unknwon, we can use implicit score matching)

The second contributions of the authors revolve around the sampling process, and they indeitfy tghe best
time descretization for the diffusion process sampling that produces best results, aided with higher order Runge-Kutta method
